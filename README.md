# **What does Super do?**
Watching "Spiderman: Across the Spiderverse" was an electrifying experience that ignited a spark of inspiration within me. As I marveled at the multiverse of superheroes, I found myself captivated by the diverse array of characters and their extraordinary abilities. Inspired by this cinematic journey, I embarked on a mission to harness the power of technology to bring the world of superheroes to life in a new way. Drawing upon the vast resources of a Superhero API, I set out to create a chatbot capable of answering questions about all superheroes, from the iconic to the obscure. With each query, users can delve deeper into the rich tapestry of comic book lore, uncovering the secrets and strengths of their favorite heroes. Just as Spiderman navigates the complexities of the multiverse, this chatbot invites users to explore the boundless possibilities of the superhero realm.
